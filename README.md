An open-source handwritten input method for Linux.

Handtux aims to provide a seamless and intuitive handwritten input method for Linux systems. It is designed to recognize and process handwritten text, allowing users to input text naturally using a stylus or touch input.

## Project Status

This project is currently under development and does not have a usable build available yet. You can help by contributing!

## Compiling/Running

You need a functioning Python environment with PyTorch, Transformers and Pillow installed. How hard can it be? (A lot.)
```bash
pip install torch transformers pillow
```

You also need a libpythonX.XX.so.1.0 installed, whatever that is....

Then you can just build and run. (And pray for it to work.)
```bash
cargo run
```
